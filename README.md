# Loreleaf

An early stage cross-browser extension for collecting and recalling fictional characters and their context.

## What's the point?

While reading novels—especially asian novels—it’s easy to forget who’s who. Loreleaf solves this by letting you attach a contextual note to characters. Once a character is annotated, their name is highlighted in the text, and hovering over it reveals a tooltip with the added note. The extension also renders an automatic glossary of all characters you’ve added.
